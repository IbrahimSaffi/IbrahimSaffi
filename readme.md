# Hi, I am Ibrahim Saffi
I am a Full-Stack-Developer who developed  an interest in programming a couple of years back and decided to pursue a career in programming. I find excitement in learning different technologies and Web development offers endless opportunities in that regard. I mostly work with the MERN stack and am always ready for any opportunity to learn something new.
